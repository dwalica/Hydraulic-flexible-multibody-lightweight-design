# Description
This project investigates how lightweight design influences structural dynamics and energy efficiency in hydraulically actuated flexible systems. The study focuses on a lift boom derived from a forestry crane model, simulated in both rigid and flexible configurations. Default and optimized lift boom designs are compared under identical proportional valve inputs, and additional analyses contrast the behavior of the rigid and flexible versions of the optimized lift boom.

## Info
- Run MainScript.py for default and optimised lift boom analysis.
- Run RigidFlexOptLB_Comparison.py for rigid and flexible optimised lift boom analysis.
